- 👋 Hi, I’m @MarkusRose
- 👀 I’m interested in computer vision and deep learning for microscopy image analysis. Data visualization is something I like to do and user interfaces are a necessary evil.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning different U-net architectures and some GANs in both tensorflow and pytorch. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any fun project from a full stack django platform for data science purposes, over ML models all the way to raspberry pi and arduino toys.
